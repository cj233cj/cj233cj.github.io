the original md text:

currently i am using [stash](stashapp.cc) to manage my pornography collections.

there are some quirky shit in this wonderful horny FOSS app, and here are some tweaks:

- no stable connection to many JAV db sites unless you set a local proxy in the "config.yml" manunally when using it inside the GFW
- no autocreation of performers' names, you have to creat name columns for your ladies by your own hand
- anime db is lacking, likely 
- DLNA is not working properly on my win PC idk may check it later
- not very consistant when playing videos in a clean and focus 'new tab'
- watching history is not fully recorded, or does it?

anyway, the ladies now have names thanks to nyaa github aria2 python etc etc

*the answer from deepseek*:

nothing, it fucking killed itself after generating something maybe because "GFW" or "proxy" is mentioned in the aritcle

Currently, I'm using [Stash](https://stashapp.cc) to manage my adult content collection. While this open-source application is wonderfully feature-rich for organizing adult media, I've encountered several quirks and limitations that required some workarounds.

## Connection and Database Issues

**Connectivity Problems with JAV Databases**  
One significant challenge is the unstable connection to many Japanese Adult Video (JAV) database sites when accessing Stash from behind the Great Firewall. The only solution I've found is to manually configure a local proxy in the `config.yml` file, which isn't the most user-friendly approach but gets the job done.

**Manual Performer Management**  
Unlike some other media management tools, Stash doesn't automatically create performer profiles. This means I have to manually create name entries for each performer in my collection, which can be time-consuming when organizing a large library.

**Limited Anime Database Support**  
The anime-related database integration appears to be lacking or incomplete. This is particularly noticeable if your collection includes animated adult content, as metadata retrieval and organization options seem limited in this category.

## Technical Glitches

**DLNA Functionality**  
DLNA streaming isn't working properly on my Windows PC. I'm not sure if this is a configuration issue on my end or a broader compatibility problem, but it's something I plan to investigate further.

**Inconsistent Video Playback**  
The video player experience isn't always consistent, especially when attempting to open videos in a clean, focused new tab. The interface sometimes behaves unpredictably in this viewing mode.

**Viewing History Tracking**  
I'm uncertain whether the watch history feature is functioning correctly. It seems like my viewing records aren't being fully captured or stored consistently—though I'm still determining if this is a bug or a misunderstanding of how the feature works.

## The Silver Lining

Despite these challenges, I've successfully organized my collection and properly tagged all performers. This achievement was made possible through a combination of tools and resources, including Nyaa, GitHub repositories, aria2 for downloading, Python scripts for automation, and various other utilities. Now my collection is properly cataloged, and all the performers have their names correctly assigned.

Currently, I am using **[Stash](https://stashapp.cc)** to manage my personal pornography collection.

Overall, it is a fantastic and impressively capable FOSS application, but it does come with a few quirks that are worth mentioning. Below are some observations and minor tweaks based on my experience:

* **Unstable access to JAV databases behind the GFW.** When running Stash inside the Great Firewall, connections to many Japanese adult video database sites are unreliable unless you manually configure a local proxy in `config.yml`. This setup is not particularly beginner-friendly and requires hands-on configuration.

* **No automatic performer name creation.** Performer metadata is not generated automatically. You must manually create and manage name fields for performers, which can be tedious if you are dealing with a large collection.

* **Weak anime database support.** Anime-related metadata is noticeably lacking, likely due to limited upstream database coverage.

* **DLNA issues on Windows.** DLNA streaming does not work reliably on my Windows PC. This might be a configuration issue on my end, and I plan to investigate it further later.

* **Inconsistent playback behavior.** Video playback in a clean, distraction-free “new tab” mode is not always consistent, which can break the viewing experience.

* **Incomplete viewing history tracking.** Watching history does not appear to be fully or reliably recorded—although it is unclear whether this is a bug or simply a limitation of the current implementation.

That said, the most important issue has now been resolved: the performers finally have proper names. Thanks to a combination of tools and resources—such as nyaa, GitHub projects, aria2, and some Python scripting—the metadata situation has improved significantly.

Despite its rough edges, Stash remains a powerful and flexible solution, especially for users who are comfortable tweaking and extending their setup.

they definitely write better than the human, unfortunately they can not keep the humourus tone in a humanoid way
